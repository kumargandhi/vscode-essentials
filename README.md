# Visual Studio Code (vs-code) essentials
## This is how I use the Visual Studio Code (vs-code) as a web developer.

VS Code is a super free and widely used [IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that is loved by the open web community. If you are a web developer and have not heard of it or used it before, you may be living under a rock the size of Mount Everest. Just saying... I, myself, am a web developer and use this IDE frequently. I thought I would document how I use it in case this information might be useful to others.

`Note:` There are many articles / post, youtube videos about the VS code to get started and also to code as a pro. I am only documenting for my own purpose.
