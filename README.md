# Visual Studio Code (vs-code) essentials
## This is how I use the Visual Studio Code (vs-code) as a web developer.

VS code is an [IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is super free and widely used, and loved by the open web community. If you are a web developer, and not using it or hearing about it the first time then you are truly living under a rock the size of mount everest. Just saying...

I myself am a web developer and I use this IDE every other day. And I thought, let me document how I use the IDE, maybe, just maybe, this information might be usefull to others.

`Note:` There are many articles / post, youtube videos about the VS code to get started and also to code as a pro. I am only documenting for my own purpose.
